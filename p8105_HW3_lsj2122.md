# Problem 1

## Part 1. Description of instacart data

The instacart data set contains information about online grocery
shopping from 2017, with 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Totaling
at 20769255 data points. Key variables include `order_id`, `product_id`,
`user_id`, if an item was `reordered`, `order_hour_of_day`,
`days_since_prior_order` (ranging from 0 to 30), `product_name`,
`aisle`, and `department`.

## Part 2. Exploring the data

### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) |> 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 3
    ## # Groups:   aisle_id [134]
    ##    aisle_id aisle                          n_obs
    ##       <int> <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1       83 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2       24 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3      123 packaged vegetables fruits     78493

    ##  9       91 soy lactosefree                26240

    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles. `fresh vegetables`, `fresh fruits`, and
`packaged vegetable fruits` are the three most ordered items.

### Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

### Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

### Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
